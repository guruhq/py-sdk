    of board items where each item could be a section or card and you want to check
    which type it is.
  - `title` the displayed title for this section.

  Question objects also use a Verifier object as their `answerer`
  property, since questions can be asked to an individual or a group.

  These are the properties a Verifier object has:

  - `type`: Either the string `"user-group"` or `"user"`.

    the ID of the Group verifier.

  - `id` is the 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal ID assigned to this card. These IDs
    are helpful when matching cards to events returned by `get_events()`.
  - `title` is the card's title.
  - `content` is the card's HTML content as a string.
  - `doc` is the card's content parsed as an HTML document. This uses Beautiful
    Soup and you check check [its docs](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
    for more info.
  - `collection` is a Collection object representing the collection this card is in.
  - `boards` is a list of Board objects for all the boards this card is on.
  - `url` is the full URL you can use to access the card in Guru's webapp.
  - `verifier_label` is a string representing the verifier -- either the group name if it's
    assigned to a group or the individual verifier's email address.
  
  This object also has a lot of methods that make it easy to do
  things like verify, unverify, update, archive, add tags, add
