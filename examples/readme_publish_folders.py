"""
This script shows how to use Guru's SDK to publish cards,
folders, or entire collections to an external site, like a
third-party help site.

This is the script we use to publish our docs from Guru to
https://developer.getguru.com/docs

This script takes the contents of a folder in Guru and makes
API calls to Readme (https://readme.com/) to create or update
docs in Readme based on the changes seen in Guru. There are
a few parts to this:

1. Behind the scenes, the SDK enumerates all the folders
   and cards on the folder we specify.
2. The SDK also writes a metadata .json file to keep track
   of which cards have been published before.
3. Using the metadata, the SDK knows whether a card has been
   published before and needs to be updated in Readme or is
   a brand new card and we need to create a doc in Readme.

The SDK orchestrates everything and this file just needs to
implement methods that call Readme's API to do specific tasks.
When the SDK sees a card that's never been published before,
it'll call create_external_card and we need to implement how
the API call to Readme is made to create the doc in Readme.
