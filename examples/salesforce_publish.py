"""
This script shows how to use Guru's SDK to publish cards, folders, or entire
collections to an external site -- in this case, Salesforce Knowledge.

This script takes the contents of a folder in Guru and makes API calls to
Salesforce to create or update Knowledge objects as needed.

1. Behind the scenes, the SDK enumerates all the sections and cards on the
   folder we specify.
2. The SDK also writes a metadata .json file to keep track of which cards have
   been published before.
3. Using the metadata, the SDK knows whether a card has been published before
   and needs to be updated in Saleforce or is a brand new card and we need to
   create a Knowledge object in Salesforce.

The SDK orchestrates everything and this file just needs to implement methods
that call SFDC's API to do specific tasks. When the SDK sees a card that's never
been published before, it'll call create_external_card and we implement the POST
call to create the external representation of a card (e.g. the Knowledge object)

This script uses these environment variables:

 - GURU_USER and GURU_TOKEN to authenticate Guru API calls.
 - SFDC_CLIENT_ID
 - SFDC_CLIENT_SECRET
 - SFDC_USERNAME
 - SFDC_PASSWORD
 - SFDC_TOKEN
